# 4900 Project
CISC-4900 Project, supervised by Professor Hui Chen. 

The files that are being uploaded here are the stuff I worked on in the supervised project: Webvulmap(Mapping Security Vulnerability between Computer Science Body of Knowledge). 

The primary goal of the application is to help people look up mappings
between Computer Science and Software Security topics. As an instructor,
it can be useful to find the right software security topics to plug in a
class, and as a student you can look up and see which computer science
might offer you an opportunity to learn a Software Security topic.

There are two major tasks for me:

1. To create the map between computer science knowledge topics and
software security topics

2. To enhance the web application when 1 is done
