# 4900 Project
CISC-4900 Project, supervised by Professor Hui Chen. 

The files that are being uploaded here are the tasks I worked on in the supervised project: Webvulmap(Mapping Security Vulnerability between Computer Science Body of Knowledge). 
The main repository is owned by my supervisor aka Professor Hui Chen, the public repository is linked here: https://github.com/RealVulnerabilityEdu/webvulmap/commits/main/
Please note that both repositories are the same, once the changes have been commited in the private repository it will then be done the same with the public one. 
The reason behind on having two repositories is also because of privacy reasons.

This is the project's website: https://secwebmap.streamlit.app

The primary goal of the application is to help people look up mappings
between Computer Science and Software Security topics. As an instructor,
it can be useful to find the right software security topics to plug in a
class, and as a student you can look up and see which computer science
might offer you an opportunity to learn a Software Security topic.

There are two major tasks for me:

1. To create the map between computer science knowledge topics and
software security topics

2. To enhance the web application when 1 is done


My first task was to familiarize with the processing pipeline of parsing a knowledge area. 
The input to the pipeline is the CS2013 pdf file, and the output is a JSON file for the selected knowledge area.
I will show the steps on how to parse the knowledge areas into the JSON file in the near future once I have more work done. 

Once I understand how the application works I will then manually map a small set of
topics/software security topics, then the goal is to use it to train a machine learning
model to map the rest.
